Original TX81Z has been designed to use a transformer-based 10W power supply providing +5V, +15V and -15V voltages. While +5V is used to power all digital parts of the device, dual +/-15V voltage is used to provide Vcc+ and Vcc- to several operational amplifiers used in analog circuit. Nowdays a lot of single-supply OpAmps are available thus allowing to simplify power supply design. The following replacement OpAmps has been tested:
